# Higher-Order-standardized-momnets
Hello, 
I currently am working on higher order statistical features. 
The first ones that I focused on were higher order moments. 
MATLAB has predefined functions for skewness and kurtosis, however for orders higher than 4 there is nothing. 
So I decided to write a small code for those who may what to use such features. 
In the std_moment file you can calculate the standardized moments of higher order from a vector or a matrix. 
I will add the paper related to this work after it is published. Please cite appropriately, if you wish to use this function. 
In the future I will add other features as well.

The function's inputs and outputs and how to use them is explained in the script.
